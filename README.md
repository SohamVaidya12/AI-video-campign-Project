## ðŸŽ­ Realistic Avatars with HeyGen

As part of the AI video campaigns, I created multiple **realistic and professional AI avatars** using **HeyGen**. These avatars were used to deliver promotional messages, narrate investment stories, and present market news in an engaging and human-like manner.

### ðŸ”§ Avatar Creation Workflow:

2. **Script Integration** â€“ Added scripts written using ChatGPT for narration/dialogue.
3. **Voice Syncing** â€“ Used ElevenLabs or HeyGenâ€™s built-in voices for lifelike speech.
4. **Styling** â€“ Customized gestures, outfits, expressions, and background.
5. **Rendering** â€“ Exported high-resolution avatar videos for campaign use.
